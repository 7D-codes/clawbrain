## Problem Section

### Headline

```
Your Productivity Stack is Broken
```

**Alternative:**
```
Too Many Tools. Lost Context. No Privacy.
```

---

### Body Copy

```
You're juggling Notion for notes, Todoist for tasks, and ChatGPT for AI help.

Every time you switch apps, you pay a 23-minute focus tax. Every "AI feature" 
is just a chatbot bolted onto a dashboard.

Your AI doesn't remember. Your data isn't yours. And you're paying for 5 
different subscriptions just to stay organized.

There's a better way.
```

---

## Solution Section

### Headline

```
Chat-First Productivity
```

**Alternative:**
```
AI-Native Task Management
```

---

### Body Copy

```
ClawBrain is built around conversation, not configuration.

Just type "Remind me to review the Q4 report Friday" — your AI creates the 
task, schedules it, and adds it to your Kanban board. All in one flow.

Ask "What did I work on yesterday?" and your AI knows. Because it's been 
part of the conversation all along.

No more context switching. No more copy-paste. Just chat and work.
```

---

## How It Works Section

### Headline

```
From Chat to Kanban in Seconds
```

---

### 3-Step Flow

**Step 1 — Chat Naturally**
```
"What tasks do I have this week?"
"Add 'Call Sarah' to my follow-ups"
"Remind me about the website launch Monday"
```

**Step 2 — Watch It Appear**
```
Tasks appear instantly in your Kanban board. Organized, prioritized, 
and ready to go. No clicking through menus. No filling forms.
```

**Step 3 — Stay in Sync**
```
Drag tasks in the board? Your AI knows. Update via chat? The board updates. 
Everything stays synchronized automatically.
```
