# ClawBrain Marketing Skills — Adaptation Complete

**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Task:** Clone and adapt Corey Haines' marketingskills for ClawBrain

## What Was Done

Cloned `github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills` and adapted 4 key skills specifically for ClawBrain:

### Skills Created

| Skill | Purpose | Key Adaptations |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `launch-strategy` | 5-phase launch plan, ORB framework | ClawBrain positioning, OpenClaw community integration, Product Hunt strategy |
| `product-marketing-context` | Positioning/messaging doc | Target personas (developer, founder, privacy-first user), competitive landscape (vs Notion AI, Mem.ai) |
| `copywriting` | Homepage, emails, social | ClawBrain-specific templates, voice/tone guidelines |
| `page-cro` | Landing page optimization | Waitlist conversion focus, GitHub star optimization |

### Key Frameworks Adapted

**ORB Channel Strategy:**
- Owned: Email list, blog, Discord, YouTube
- Rented: Twitter/X, LinkedIn, HN, Reddit  
- Borrowed: Podcasts, influencers, OpenClaw community

**Five-Phase Launch:**
1. Internal (friends/family) — CURRENT
2. Alpha (waitlist, controlled)
3. Beta (scaled access, content marketing)
4. Early Access (Product Hunt prep)
5. Full Launch (open signups)

**ClawBrain Positioning:**
- AI-native (not bolted-on)
- Self-hosted (your data, your control)
- File-based (portable, future-proof)
- Bidirectional sync (chat ↔ Kanban)
- OpenClaw-powered (extensible)
