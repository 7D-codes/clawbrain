## 1. Podcast Pitch Email

**Subject:** Open-source AI second brain — guest pitch for [Podcast Name]

```
Hi [Host Name],

I'm [Your Name], founder of ClawBrain — an open-source AI-native second brain 
that combines chat-based AI with Kanban task management.

**Why this might fit your audience:**
- Built in public over 3 months
- Self-hosted (privacy-first) alternative to Notion AI, Mem.ai
- AI-native interface vs bolted-on AI features
- File-based (markdown), no vendor lock-in
- Target audience: developers, founders, privacy-conscious knowledge workers

**Potential topics:**
- Building AI tools in public (the journey, technical decisions)
- Privacy-first business models in the AI era
- Why "AI-native" beats "AI-powered"
- Open source sustainability and community building

I'm a fan of [specific episode/reference] and think your audience would 
resonate with the bootstrapped/open-source angle.

Happy to work around your schedule. I can also share a demo video or 
screenshots if helpful.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. — ClawBrain launches [month] and early traction has been strong with 
the OpenClaw/self-hosted community.

## Email Best Practices

**Do:**
- Personalize every email (mention something specific)
- Keep it short (under 200 words ideally)
- Clear ask (what do you want them to do?)
- Provide value (why should they care?)
- One follow-up only (don't be pushy)

**Don't:**
- Send mass emails (use mail merge at minimum)
- Write long walls of text
- Ask for multiple things
- Be generic ("dear blogger")
- Follow up more than once

**Timing:**
- Send Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM recipient's timezone
- Avoid Mondays (inbox overflow) and Fridays (checked out)
- Follow up once after 5-7 days

**Tracking:**
- Use simple spreadsheet: Name, Outlet, Date Sent, Response, Status
- Track open rates if using email tool
- Note what approaches work best

*Customize templates for each outreach. Personalization wins.*
