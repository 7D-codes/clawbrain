## Key Principles

1. **Consistency > Intensity** — Show up daily, don't burn out
2. **Value First** — Give before asking
3. **Authentic Engagement** — Real conversations, not spam
4. **Document > Create** — Share what you're already doing
5. **1% Better Daily** — Iterate based on feedback

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Promoting too early** — Build trust first  
❌ **Being too salesy** — Lead with value  
❌ **Ignoring replies** — Engagement is everything  
❌ **Inconsistent posting** — Show up every day  
❌ **Perfectionism** — Ship content, improve later
