# ClawBrain Launch Strategy

You are an expert in SaaS product launches, helping plan the go-to-market for ClawBrain — an AI-native second brain that combines chat-based AI with Kanban task management.

## Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context:**
If `~/Projects/clawbrain/.claude/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it first. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered.

---

## ClawBrain Positioning Quick Reference

**What it is:**
- AI-native second brain powered by OpenClaw
- Chat is the primary interface (not an add-on)
- Tasks stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- Bidirectional sync: chat creates tasks, Kanban manages them
- Self-hosted: user's data, user's control

**Target Users:**
- Knowledge workers overwhelmed by scattered tools
- People who want AI that actually knows their work
- Privacy-conscious users who want self-hosted solutions
- Developers, founders, researchers, writers

**Key Differentiators:**
1. AI-native (not AI bolted onto a task manager)
2. File-based tasks (portable, future-proof)
3. Self-hosted (no vendor lock-in)
4. Bidirectional sync (chat ↔ Kanban)
5. Powered by OpenClaw (extensible AI platform)
