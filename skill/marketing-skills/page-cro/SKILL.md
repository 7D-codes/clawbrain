# ClawBrain Page CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization)

You help optimize ClawBrain marketing pages to convert more visitors into users. You focus on clarity, reducing friction, and guiding visitors toward the desired action.

## Before Starting

**Check for context:**
- Read `~/Projects/clawbrain/.claude/product-marketing-context.md` if it exists
- Know the desired conversion action (email signup, repo star, waitlist join, etc.)

**ClawBrain Key Conversions:**
1. Star the GitHub repo (awareness)
2. Join the waitlist (interest)
3. Self-host ClawBrain (activation)
4. Sign up for OneClaw managed hosting (revenue)

---

## Core Principles

### 1. One Goal Per Page
Every page should have ONE primary action. Don't ask for 5 things.

**ClawBrain Homepage:**
- Primary: Join waitlist
- Secondary: View GitHub repo

### 2. Reduce Cognitive Load
Visitors decide in 3-5 seconds. Make it obvious what you do and why they should care.

### 3. Clear Hierarchy
Most important → Least important (top to bottom)

### 4. Remove Friction
Every field, every click, every decision is a chance to lose them.

## Page Audit Checklist

### Hero Section (Above the Fold)

- [ ] **Headline is clear** — Can a stranger understand what you do in 3 seconds?
- [ ] **Subhead supports headline** — Explains the "how" or "why"
- [ ] **CTA is visible** — Primary button above the fold
- [ ] **No distractions** — No navigation competing for attention (optional)
- [ ] **Visual shows product** — Screenshot, demo GIF, or video

**ClawBrain Hero Formula:**
```
Headline: Your AI Second Brain
Subhead: Chat with your tasks. Own your data. Finally, an AI that knows your work.
CTA: [Join Waitlist]
Visual: Demo GIF of chat → Kanban flow
```

### Value Proposition

- [ ] **Problem is stated** — Visitors see themselves in the description
- [ ] **Solution is clear** — How you solve it
- [ ] **Outcome is desirable** — What life looks like after

**ClawBrain Example:**
```
Problem: "Your notes are scattered. Your AI doesn't remember."
Solution: "One tool for chat, tasks, and knowledge."
Outcome: "Finally, an AI that knows your work."
```

### Social Proof

- [ ] **Testimonials** — Real quotes from real users
- [ ] **Logos** — Notable customers or publications
- [ ] **Stats** — User count, tasks created, time saved
- [ ] **Trust signals** — Open source, GitHub stars, privacy-focused

**ClawBrain Social Proof:**
- GitHub stars count
- Open source badge (MIT license)
- Early user testimonials
- "As featured on" (Product Hunt, Hacker News, etc.)

### Features → Benefits

- [ ] **Each feature has a benefit** — Not just what it does, but why it matters
- [ ] **Specific, not vague** — "Creates tasks from chat" not "AI-powered"

**ClawBrain Feature/Benefit Map:**
| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Chat interface | Create tasks without switching contexts |
| Kanban board | Visualize your work at a glance |
| File-based storage | Your data is portable and future-proof |

### CTA Placement

- [ ] **Above the fold** — Primary CTA visible without scrolling
- [ ] **After problem** — CTA when pain is felt
- [ ] **After solution** — CTA when desire is built
- [ ] **End of page** — Final chance to convert
- [ ] **Sticky header** — CTA always accessible

### Friction Reduction

- [ ] **Minimal form fields** — Email only for waitlist
- [ ] **Clear expectations** — "Join 500+ people" or "Get access in 2 weeks"
- [ ] **No surprises** — What happens after they sign up?
- [ ] **Easy to try** — Self-hosting instructions are clear

### Page Speed

- [ ] **Loads fast** — Under 3 seconds
- [ ] **Images optimized** — Compressed, lazy loaded
- [ ] **No render-blocking** — CSS/JS doesn't delay content

### Mobile Experience

- [ ] **Readable without zoom** — Font sizes appropriate
- [ ] **CTA tappable** — Buttons large enough
